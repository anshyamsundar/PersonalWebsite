		<b style="font-size:16px;">SOME PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY</b>
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		We are brought into this plane of existence at someone else's whim, and, we leave not out of our own free will, at least in most cases. 
		But do we have a reason at all to be here?  Well, a common answer I've heard oft-and-on is that God created us and that we are expected to 
		lead a life based on a set of rules given by him. I don't see how God or Man has anything at all to gain by this activity; what I've observed 
		and learnt is that nothing in nature is done without some sort of incentive.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		I like to view Science and Religion as tools that provide the same solution, albeit in different forms, to the same question: "Who are we and 
		why are we here?". Religion says we are a creation of God, who himself is omnipresent, ever-existent and indestructible. Science explains that 
		we are made of matter, and that matter and energy are inter-convertible and therefore, in essence, made of the same "material". Combining the 
		views, I am inclined to believe that God is really a function of Energy, Space and Time. Energy, Space and Time are the only parameters in nature 
		which are really independent of any other known factors and satisfy the description of God as given by religion. Since we are associated with the 
		very same parameters, we are a part of God too; and equivalently from a religious viewpoint, we are called the Children of God.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Contrary to the popular belief that God is good and just, I believe that Energy, Space and Time are beyond good and evil and therefore God can be 
		looked at as either both good and evil, or neither. If the energy in the universe is assumed to be infinite, and we are a finite part of that energy, 
		that makes us possess infinite energy mathematically - this makes us God, theoretically. And Noetic Science, I believe, will help us unleash this 
		potential latent within us all. I believe that the God-like figures that have appeared throughout the history of mankind were in reality humans 
		who learnt to harness the universal energy for the greater good. If a person possessing advanced technology and gadgets goes back centuries in time, 
		he will no doubt be regarded as God himself by the ancients, or at the very least, a messenger of God. This is evident from what is known as 
		Cargo-cult that took roots in Micronesia shortly after World War-II; when advanced nations came in contact with primitive tribes in Australasia.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		At once, it is subtle intelligence and utter foolishness of humans to attribute everything to God. While one might argue that since everything is 
		associated with energy, the former holds, we forget that we are a part of that energy too in this process, which makes the latter hold.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Newton's third law states: "Every action has an equal and opposite reaction". The point to be noted here is that this law does not state whether 
		the reaction must occur instantly or not. According to Einstein, Gravitational Force, travels at the speed of light. So it follows that reaction 
		forces are not necessarily instantaneous. And if a reaction force is not instantaneous, it obviously means you'll experience the "fruit" of your 
		actions sometime in the future. This answers a crucial question pertaining to the Law of Karma. And it follows that there is no reason to say that 
		hurting or doing good another human being in some way or the other will not affect you in the future - I like to view it as a natural consequence 
		of the Karmic law. As Confucius says "Do unto others what you like them to do unto you".
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		I think this view of the Karmic Law answers why we are pulled into this plane of existence. And I have to admit my ignorance on why the actions had 
		originated in the first place - I earnestly hope Science can answer this question in the near future. I have to admit my ignorance on other accounts 
		as well: I do not yet know how to reason why energy has to exist in the first place; neither can I fathom why energy, space and time has to give rise 
		to a plane of existence that we are currently in - in other words, why can't energy be static? To put it forward from a religious viewpoint, it really 
		the same as asking: "Why does God exist, think and do as he does?". I am not aware of any plausible reason given by either Science or Religion on this 
		issue.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Understanding our role in the universe and the reason for the actions and the consequences will eventually help us lead better lives and design a 
		happier world. Good ideas can change the world; and better ideas can make the process of change for the better permanent.

		<b style="font-size:16px;">TAKE ON THE MODERN AGE</b>
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Each era has its obsessions, hopes and prejudices shaped by the one before. From what I've observed, each generation considers itself more 
		intelligent than the one before and wiser than the one that comes after. Going back a few centuries, when religious institutions were at the 
		zenith of their power, we had a generation that believed blindly in the directives of the religious leaders. And there was a general notion that 
		doing so was being extremely wise and that it guaranteed them a good afterlife. It is worthwhile noting that the power of this institution faded 
		rapidly within the few successive centuries.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Renaissance followed this era, and was considered to be the age that ushered in enlightenment. However, history tells us that this period hadn't 
		been relatively smooth in terms of power struggles. The successive generation in the 1800s had an unprecedented number of inventions to its credit 
		and this single-handedly gave birth to the industrial revolution.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		This time, it gets interesting again: we witness a power-shift from the inventors to the industrialists. Power, which was once nearly considered 
		proprietary by religious institutions was now in the hands of people with considerable economic clout. This is the era in which we live today.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Today, we witness ongoing struggles of various genres between nations, provinces, groups and individuals. Neutralize the economic factor behind these 
		"battles" and one would find most of the battles turn into a lost cause.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		We live in an age where money, wealth and status take precedence. We do not hesitate to go to any extent to seemingly establish ourselves on an equal 
		standing with our immediate peers. While the general competitive spirit must be encouraged, one cannot help but notice the vain ways into which we 
		have fallen. We drink anything that is branded - even grape juice that rots for decades together (read alcohol) and smoke stuff that will eventually 
		cost us our health and in the process, spend gargantuan sums of money towards medical expenses. This is ridiculous considering the fact that drugs 
		which have a similar effect are banned by law in most countries. The hypocrisy professed by the society is by no means restricted to just these 
		examples. Most speak of showing compassion to all living, yet, we mass-murder animals for food and clothing. If I may ask, isn't Man an animal too? 
		If selective murder does not amount to discrimination and killing a fellow human is still a crime, aren't we being too biased towards ourselves? 
		In other words, aren't we being racist? I have come across instances where absurd claims of divine directives are used to justify such actions; 
		I personally find this unacceptable by any standard. [By the way, I happen to be a vegetarian, teetotaler and a non-smoker]
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
	    Each generation has its flaws which it must strive to correct. The path of perfection is a long one; the need of the hour is for man to free himself 
		intellectually. This, I believe, can happen only through education. Education in my opinion cannot be restricted to a specific set of coursework or 
		syllabi. Education must teach the individual to think on his own, discover and realize the potential within. This is my personal equivalent of what is 
		known as self-realization in some religious circles. This may cause outrage to a lot of people, but I believe the solution to the troubles of mankind 
		is not God to come down to earth as a Man, but Man to ascend as a God.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Each newly discovered revolutionary fact goes through three stages: First people would say it is a crazy, dangerous and unacceptable idea. Next, 
		they would state firmly they always knew this truth. Lastly, they will boldly proclaim that they have always believed it. From my personal experience, 
		I have realized that admitting one's ignorance is the first and the best step to learning and change.
