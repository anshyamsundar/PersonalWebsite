	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
		So here's something about me - As you must have already guessed, I am a denizen of the Milky Way galaxy and am a native of the Solar System 
		living on a planet called Earth. My current center of mass lies approximately at latitude 33.7489° N with the longitude being 84.3881° W. 
		I'm primarily made up of the elements Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen like most living creatures in my vicinity and belong to the class of species 
		called homosapiens.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
		Okay, that bit of information was probably useful to you if you lived anywhere more than a lightyear away from me. 
		My name is Shyam Sundar and I graduated with an MS in Electrical Engineering from Clemson University, USA. 
		Prior to this, I pursued by B. Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli, India. 
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
		By profession, I am an Electrical and a Software Engineer with a specialization in Robotics, Computer Vision and Control. 
		I often get asked as to what I prefer doing over the other - designing circuits and systems, or writing software. 
		As an innate roboticist, I would deem it crippling if I couldn't design and use software and hardware with equal dexterity. 
		I like to view software and hardware as equally important aspects of a system which are to be carefully crafted and designed 
		to mesh well with each other if we are to expect the system to work flawlessly.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
		Over the last few years, I have additionally been working towards a law degree (which is essentially a full-time job in itself, away from my regular
		full-time job as a Software Engineer), and I expect to graduate with an LLB degree in December 2025. This decision has been a culmination of a 
		series of events, both personal and professional. In hindsight, this could arguably be said to be attributable to a stroke of destiny for the religiously
		inclined, and a causal state of existence for the more scientifically disposed.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
		Away from work, I like to learn and experiment with newer programming languages, packages and libraries, not to mention my Arduino 
		micro-controller kit. Over weekends, I occasionally work as an independent software developer from home and develop custom applications 
		from open-source tools for client companies. Working as an independent software developer has been a very rewarding experience. 
		As a engineer, I find it immensely satisfying to see customer-specific applications built from scratch be maintained and used by 
		clients on a regular basis. A particular habit I have developed since my school days is to try and break the code I write using any means at 
		my disposal. While this could get a bit messy at times, rewriting and redesigning entire projects to get robust software out to customers 
		has paid off in the long run.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
		Engineering and break-dancing have both been my passion for as long as I can remember. 
		While in the middle of a really good, challenging project, I usually resort to music and dance to keep me fresh and energized to the finish.
