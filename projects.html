	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The Freeze Switch is a device that is used to prevent probe drift. The fine positioners on the Nanoprober are in an open loop configuration,
		with no encoder feedback as to their position, and additionally actuated by piezo crystals. The Freeze Switch controller, in its essence, operates
		a mechanical relay that cuts off power to the piezo crystals so as to maintain their shape, and minimize probe drift. Here, an API for the freeze switch 
		was developed and integrated into the Nanoprober software architecture.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The Load Testing module, on the other hand, is an expansive module that runs and manages scripts and workflows for every aspect of tool functionality.
		Its function is to perform a stress test on tools, and thereby facilitate system qualification. It also collects and categorizes data collected over the 
		course of multiple rounds of stress testing for further analysis.

		Nanoprober is subject to various regulatory requirements, such as the EU GDPR and California SB-327. This involved an extensive software

		The practical (and math) problem that was tackled and solved here is to detect whether after a given set of motion(s), the probes in a nanoprober
		have a risk of crashing into each other. To the extent that there is a risk, this risk is minimized by moving the probes in an optimal pattern,
		depending on the kind of motion executed. This algorithm, at its core, models each motion as a vector and orders the motion vectors in a manner 
		that maximizes the distances between the vectors, while minimizing intersecting motions.

		<b style="font-size:16px;">EBIRCH module to enable EBAC/EBIC imaging</b>
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		This project integrates new EBIRCH hardware to improve the signal to noise ratio of generated gradient images used for electrical fault isolation.
		EBIRCH stands for Electron Beam Induced Resistance Change. This is used to detect shorts in the circuit by inducing a local heating effect using
		the electron beam from the scanning electron microscope. The change in detected current fed between the landing pads (maintained at a specific voltage)
		would spike in areas where a short is present. Each point of the electron beam scan generates two images - a visual image from scattered electrons, and
		a corresponding EBIRCH image constructed from the measured current corresponding to each pixel of the scan.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		EBAC stands for Electron Beam Absorbed Current. This technique is used to find opens in the circuit by scanning the circuit with an electron beam, and
		measuring the detected current at every raster point via landed probes at circuit terminals. Opens are detected at spots where a conductive path ought to 
		exist per the theoretical design, but doesn't (as evidenced by the lack of detected current).
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		While EBIRCH and EBAC focus on finding physical defects in metal lines, EBIC (Electron Beam Induced Current) is used to analyze the active semiconductor 
		regions—specifically p-n junctions and the behavior of charge carriers within the silicon itself.

	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Tungsten probes such as the one used in Nanoprobers aren't completely immune from oxidation, though they possess immense corrosion 
		resistance. Over the course of usage, tungsten probes can additionally get contaminated with external artifacts, such as carbon deposits. 		
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The commonly used approach to clean such probes would be to cross two similar probes and pass a carefully calibrated burst of pulse(s) of 
		current depending on the contamination level. The challenge is that if we pass too much current/power, we risk melting/deforming the probes. Passing
		too little current would mean that the probes remain dirty. 
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The engineering challenge here was two-fold. One, guide the probes automatically using computer vision and electrical measurement techniques so 
		as to cross and touch them at the desired cross section. Two, design an optimal pulsing mechanism that would likely clean the probes without 
		damaging them. This mechanism would also retry a clean if the prior cleaning run hasn't been completely satisfactory.

		This project involved a complete overhaul of the charting tool used by the Nanoprober software. The legacy codebase used 
		National Instruments charting libraries. This was replaced with a more capable and feature rich LightningChart charting library 
		from Arction. The motivation was to support multiple X and Y axes, faster charting times as to electrical measurements, and

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		This project was critical for making the jump from Nanoprober 1 to Nanoprober 2. Nanoprober 1 was fully manual, with no 
		algorithms to automate the process of bringing the probes to the desired field of view by guiding the probe tips and
		planing them. The scanning electron microscope's beam characteristics (focus, wobble and stigmation) are used to ensure that
		the SEM imaging is optimized. The focal distances of the probe tips are used to gauge the Z-locations of the probes and align them
		on the same Z-plane.		
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The focus metric is calculated using a variance metric of the gradients across the probe tips. The stigmation was optimized by 
		evaluating geometric symmetry across the probe tips, while the wobble ensures that the electron beam is perpendicular to the 
		plane of view.

		<b style="font-size:16px;">PLL-based force feedback module</b>
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The force feedback module is a hardware-based solution to detect probe touch on a surface. The basic principle behind its 
		operation is akin to that of a tuning fork.		
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Imagine a probe that is vibrating at a certain frequency. If the probe comes close to or does touch a physical surface, 
		three parameters change - the amplitude and frequency of the vibration, and the vibration itself experiences a phase shift in tandem 
		with the change in the frequency. 
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is a device that internally tracks a reference signal at a certain pre-defined frequency. The probe is connected
		to a crystal oscillator that used to generate this reference frequency. The PLL internally implements a PID controller used for
		exciting this crystal oscillator and locks on to the reference frequency at the point where it peaks in amplitude (resonant frequency). When the probes touch or are
		close to touching a surface, force applied to the probe as a result of the physical touch or from the Van Der Waals forces of attraction cause
		a shift in the resonant frequency. The PID control loop within the PLL tries to adjust the excitation signal to match the new resonant frequency.
		A probe touch can be detected by continuously monitoring for the extent of the change in phase/frequency shift in the excitation signal generated by the PLL - a threshold
		number can be used to fine-tune the extent of touch. A Soft dB MK3 Open Source PLL controller was used for this project.

		This was purely an feasibility study on being able to count the number of corrugated sheets in a given stack using images taken 
		in a corrugated sheet factory. While an algorithm like the Hough transform to detect lines (and thereby count the number of sheets) proved successful,

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The problem statement goes as follows: Given N vertical laser distance measurements of a sheet placed on a flat surface, 
		find out the direction of sheet warp and the extent/nature of the warp. The practical problem we're trying to solve here is
		to figure out which ones of the hot rollers (top or bottom) needs to have its temperature adjusted to ensure the corrugated 
		sheets turn out straight and without any warp.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		One elegant solution that was arrived at was to approximate a quadratic or a parabola from the measured data using the least squares
		method. The sign of the value of the coefficient "a" in y = ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c would indicate the direction of warp.

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The primary goal of this thesis work was to develop an algorithm to estimate the pose(s) of a known set of different object(s) 
		from a single image. The motivation behind taking up this project was to lay down a framework that could be used and extended 
		to figure out the most optimal path to disassemble an object assembly into its identifiable constituent components.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 The algorithm developed uses a combination of various computer vision techniques including color-based segmentation, 
		 camera calibration and corner detection for identifying various objects in the image and obtaining a coarse estimate 
		 of their positions. This estimate is fine-tuned using a RANSAC-like algorithm which is used to obtain the positions of 
		 the objects in the image in terms of the camera coordinates as translational and rotational matrices.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 The algorithm was used to estimate the pose of 28 objects in 22 images, where some images contain multiple objects. 
		 The algorithm has been found to work with a 3D mismatch error of less than 2.5cm in 90% of the cases and less than 1cm 
		 error in 53% of the cases in the dataset used. The algorithm was implemented inMatlab and camera calibration was done in C, 
		 using the OpenCV computer vision library.

	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The Universal Gripper is a novel manipulator that relies on the distortion produced by vacuum in an elastic ball partially 
		filled with coffee grinds. The Coffee grinds are prevented from being sucked into the vacuum pump using a multi-layered 
		cheese cloth filter supported by a wire gauze.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 In the first version, a gel-filled stress ball is emptied and partially filled filled with coffee grinds. This arrangement 
		 is connected to a vacuum pump through a cheesecloth filter. When stress ball is kept on an appropriate object and the vacuum pump is turned on, the air is sucked out and the ball firmly wraps around the object by adopting an appropriate configuration.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 In the second version, this design was modified to use a thin plastic bag, rather than a polymer cloth that the stress ball used. 
		 This modification was essential in order to have the manipulator grip and lift larger, smoother objects.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The third version of the universal gripper design utilizes a latex balloon packed with coffee grinds, up to 85% by volume. 
		The latex balloon performed markedly better than the gripper made using the thin plastic bag in terms of both the strength 
		of the grip and the stability of the grip. In addition, the balloon proved to be less prone to damage resulting from surface 
		strain caused by the gripping action.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		This project is based on the Universal Gripper developed earlier at Cornell University. The motivation behind exploring this idea 
		was the necessity of having a reliable gripper that could be adapted for actuating various tasks such as object disassembly 
		(which was my graduate thesis work) and cleaning up an environment when mounted on a mobile robot.

		This work was done towards my final project in Computer Vision. The motivation behind the choice of the topic was to explore the 
		possibility of developing a more natural, gesture-based interface between humans and machines.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		In this project, algorithms to recognize static and dynamic gestures were developed and were used to control an ActivMedia mobile 
		robot. The recognized static gestures indicates the pointed direction in a versatile fashion and moves the robot in the direction 
		pointed. For the dynamic gestures, the user could stand in front of the camera and control a virtual steering wheel using the motion 
		of either a single fist or both. The program would recognize the steering angle and move the robot accordingly.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The algorithms were prototyped in C++ (IDE: Visual Studio 2008). The libraries used were the Blepo computer vision library 
		(For standard computer vision modules) and the Aria mobile robot library (For hardware interfacing).

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		This work was done towards my final project in Digital Image Processing. The objective was to develop an algorithm that would 
		eliminate background white noise in any given image. The algorithm developed over the course of the project could be used to 
		clean any video sequence provided the noise levels between successive frames don't vary heavily.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The algorithm was prototyped in MATLAB and was tested on the NASA moon landing videos. The original video had a lot of background 
		noise and poor contrast. Two variants of the algorithm was run over the original sequence and videos with lower noise levels 
		and better contrast were obtained.

		<b style="font-size:16px;">Design of Pong Game GUI for a gaming robot (Sept-Oct, 2009)</b>
	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The conventional pong game assumes elastic collisions where no energy is lost by the ball when it hits the pads. 
		Thus, would not help us predict the position and velocity of a real ball at a given instant of time.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The program essentially simulates the pong game for a ball whose coefficient of restitution was specified. 
		Therefore, for known board dimensions, given an initial velocity and position for a ball whose coefficient of restitution 
		is known,  one could predict its future position and velocity so as to be able to control the pads to hit the moving ball 
		at the appropriate instant. The software was written using Windows scripting.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The idea behind the task is to eventually design a robot that would play a pong game against a human player without the use 
		of a vision system. One pad is autonomous and is controlled by the computer, while the other pad is teleoperated by a human. 
		The pads are given only 1 degree of freedom so that the problem is mathematically solvable.

	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Towards my senior-level undergraduate project, I was involved in the development of an Amphibious Robotic vehicle. 
		The robot being developed right from the scratch, the work comprised of a plethora of tasks, ranging from the mechanical design 
		to the internal electronic circuitry.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		In addition to the robot being water resistant and capable of sustaining loads of up to 50 kilograms theoretically, 
		the physical design integrated the land and water propellers into one unit so as to minimize the cost. The internal electronics 
		essentially consists of 4 stages: 1.)Transmission/Reception 2.) High frequency amplification 3.) Frequency to analog voltage 
		conversion 4.) Analog to digital conversion and control. Each frequency transmitted is uniquely interpreted upon reception so 
		as to enable the vehicle to execute motion in a different direction. Here, 4 different frequencies are interpreted so as to 
		enable motion in forward, left, right and reverse directions. Further, an onboard circuit to indicate high moisture levels was 
		incorporated.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Owing to the uniqueness of the work, this project was fully funded by my Alma mater and was eventually covered by the

	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Molybdenum trioxide nano-particles can be produced by oxidizing molybdenum metal under controlled temperature and pressure. 
		The process of oxidation is itself initiated by heating a thin wire of molybdenum metal by maintaining a high-voltage DC source 
		between the ends of the metal strip. While it is worthwhile noting that the oxidation of the metal can be achieved by using a 
		high voltage AC-signal (Generated using a conventional fly-back transformer), this technique is generally not preferred for the 
		process owing to skin-effect.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		For this purpose, a circuit that converts an AC signal to a desired value of DC must be used. Now, this might be achieved by 
		simply using a rectifier at the optput stage of a voltage up-converter. However, the drawback here is that this design is not 
		flexible enough to tune it to any arbitrary value of DC output voltage.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The designed circuit essentially outputs a tunable high voltage DC as long as a button switch is pressed. An outline of the 
		circuit can be found here.

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		A rectangular waveguide behaves like a high-pass filter whose critical frequency depends on the dimension of its cross-section. 
		A CPW antenna on the other hand behaves like a low-pass filter, whose characteristics are determined by the type of the substrate 
		used and the dimensions and spacing between the coplanar metal strips. The propagation characteristics of the CPW antennas with 
		different values of substrate permittivity and dimensions of the metal strips and spacing are studied.

		Over the summer of 2008, I associated myself with a project involving an eighty-axis robot underway at the

		attached to puppets and make them dance to the played music.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The original design used a 256 MB flash memory card as an external memory device. Consequently, it could not hold 
		enough data for feeding the controller and the system could not function for more than 15 minutes at a stretch. 
		Consequently, I interfaced the microcontroller C8051F120X with an SD card that could hold upto 4GB of data and 
		developed UART protocols for interfacing the microcontroller with the PC.

	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		As an sophomore, I attended two workshops on Robotics organized by the Robotics and Machine Intelligence group at NIT Trichy. 
		The first workshop focused on building a line-follower robot circuit using an Atmel Atmega8 microcontroller, IR sensors, 
		motor controllers and related components. Towards the end of the first workshop, I realized that programming a microcontroller 
		had its limitations - it simply couldn't process realtime data from the IR sensors as fast as I would have liked it to. 
		Having had a course in digital electronics concurrently, I took up redesigning the circuit with just basic logic blocks.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		I hardcoded the sensor-dependent motor logic in at the output stage of a 1-16 demux (Realized using two 1-8 open-collector demuxes). 
		I used 4 IR sensors - that gave me a unique 4-digit binary number. This binary number was fed as the control input to the demux. 
		Appropriate demux outputs were tied to the source through a resistor. There were essentially 2 signals derived from this - each 
		activates a motor (2 motors were used) when high.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		There were IR detectors that fed a base current to transistors that controlled power supply to motors. 
		They were used to stop the line-follower at IR signals. After the third IR signal, the logic was to be inverted - the robot 
		had to follow a white line instead of black. So the IR detectors were interfaced to a digital counter which inverted the 
		inputs when necessary at the input stage itself using an XOR-Gate.

		<b style="font-size:16px;">Attenuating Circuits simulation software (Sept-Oct, 2006)</b>
	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The basic functionality of an attenuating circuit is to get a signal of a specific waveform and power level, and output a similar 
		waveform with a relatively lower power. These circuits are necessary at the input stage of any micro-circuit which operate on very 
		low input power - High power levels can fry the internal circuitry.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Any attenuating circuit is generally characterized by Input impedance (Zi), Output impedance (Zo) and Attenuation(α). 
		Given these three parameters, and that input impedance equals the output impedance, it is possible to design a unique 
		L-type equivalent attenuating network for the two effective parameters (Impedance and Attenuation).
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The software generates circuit diagrams of the L-type network, and equivalent circuitry in symmetric form as T, Pi, 
		Lattice and Bridge type networks. The basic principle that makes this possible is that there is one and only one unique 
		symmetric circuit of the types mentioned before (T, Pi, Lattice and Bridge) for a given L-type network. The length of the 
		impedances as represented in the generated circuit varies logarithmically with the values of the impedances.

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The application was developed using HTML and C++.
