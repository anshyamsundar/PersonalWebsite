	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The Zigbee module is yet another communication device akin to the Bluetooth. However, the Zigbee offers a much greater 
		communication range of up to 64 kilometers, depending on the module used. This work was taken up to evaluate the feasilbility 
		of using Zigbee modules for mobile robots to communicate with each other. The immediate goal was to use this project as a 
		basis for wireless communication between micro-controllers for the Senior Design Project course (ECE 496) at Clemson University. 
		Another goal of this project was be able to replace the conventional heavy hand-radio sets with a system that required lighter 
		and less power hungry hardware.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 The communication between two MaxStream Zigbee modules was implemented using the Arduino microcontroller kit running the 
		 ATMega328 micro-controller. Owing to the Zigbee's considerable range and , this work finds applications in a variety of areas 
		 including telecommunications, healthcare and wireless automation.

	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The primary goal of this thesis work was to develop an algorithm to estimate the pose(s) of a known set of different object(s) 
		from a single image. The motivation behind taking up this project was to lay down a framework that could be used and extended 
		to figure out the most optimal path to disassemble an object assembly into its identifiable constituent components.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 The algorithm developed uses a combination of various computer vision techniques including color-based segmentation, 
		 camera calibration and corner detection for identifying various objects in the image and obtaining a coarse estimate 
		 of their positions. This estimate is fine-tuned using a RANSAC-like algorithm which is used to obtain the positions of 
		 the objects in the image in terms of the camera coordinates as translational and rotational matrices.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 The algorithm was used to estimate the pose of 28 objects in 22 images, where some images contain multiple objects. 
		 The algorithm has been found to work with a 3D mismatch error of less than 2.5cm in 90% of the cases and less than 1cm 
		 error in 53% of the cases in the dataset used. The algorithm was implemented inMatlab and camera calibration was done in C, 
		 using the OpenCV computer vision library.

	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The Universal Gripper is a novel manipulator that relies on the distortion produced by vacuum in an elastic ball partially 
		filled with coffee grinds. The Coffee grinds are prevented from being sucked into the vacuum pump using a multi-layered 
		cheese cloth filter supported by a wire gauze.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 In the first version, a gel-filled stress ball is emptied and partially filled filled with coffee grinds. This arrangement 
		 is connected to a vacuum pump through a cheesecloth filter. When stress ball is kept on an appropriate object and the vacuum pump is turned on, the air is sucked out and the ball firmly wraps around the object by adopting an appropriate configuration.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		 In the second version, this design was modified to use a thin plastic bag, rather than a polymer cloth that the stress ball used. 
		 This modification was essential in order to have the manipulator grip and lift larger, smoother objects.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The third version of the universal gripper design utilizes a latex balloon packed with coffee grinds, up to 85% by volume. 
		The latex balloon performed markedly better than the gripper made using the thin plastic bag in terms of both the strength 
		of the grip and the stability of the grip. In addition, the balloon proved to be less prone to damage resulting from surface 
		strain caused by the gripping action.
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		This project is based on the Universal Gripper developed earlier at Cornell University. The motivation behind exploring this idea 
		was the necessity of having a reliable gripper that could be adapted for actuating various tasks such as object disassembly 
		(which was my graduate thesis work) and cleaning up an environment when mounted on a mobile robot.

		Statistics show over a million laptops get stolen every year. What is more worrisome is the fact that there is a high probability 
		of sensitive personal data getting into the wrong hands. This project was primarily aimed at combating this problem.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The designed system is based on the bluetooth-based communication between a mobile-phone device which is carried by the user at all 
		times and the remote laptop. The laptop and the mobile device are initially paired securely. Either the laptop or the mobile phone 
		carries a program that polls the other device continuously and receives an acknowledgement signal in return. When the devices go out 
		of the bluetooth range, the user is immediately alerted either through a sound-file played on the mobile-phone device or on the 
		laptop. The program also provides additional options to disable the I/O devices (Mouse, Keyboard) on the laptop when the devices 
		go out of range.

		This work was done towards my final project in Computer Vision. The motivation behind the choice of the topic was to explore the

	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		In this project, algorithms to recognize static and dynamic gestures were developed and were used to control an ActivMedia mobile 
		robot. The recognized static gestures indicates the pointed direction in a versatile fashion and moves the robot in the direction 
		pointed. For the dynamic gestures, the user could stand in front of the camera and control a virtual steering wheel using the motion 
		of either a single fist or both. The program would recognize the steering angle and move the robot accordingly.

	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The conventional pong game assumes elastic collisions where no energy is lost by the ball when it hits the pads. 
		Thus, would not help us predict the position and velocity of a real ball at a given instant of time.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The program essentially simulates the pong game for a ball whose coefficient of restitution was specified. 
		Therefore, for known board dimensions, given an initial velocity and position for a ball whose coefficient of restitution 
		is known,  one could predict its future position and velocity so as to be able to control the pads to hit the moving ball 
		at the appropriate instant. The software was written using Windows scripting.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The idea behind the task is to eventually design a robot that would play a pong game against a human player without the use 
		of a vision system. One pad is autonomous and is controlled by the computer, while the other pad is teleoperated by a human. 
		The pads are given only 1 degree of freedom so that the problem is mathematically solvable.

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Towards my senior-level undergraduate project, I was involved in the development of an Amphibious Robotic vehicle. 
		The robot being developed right from the scratch, the work comprised of a plethora of tasks, ranging from the mechanical design 
		to the internal electronic circuitry.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		In addition to the robot being water resistant and capable of sustaining loads of up to 50 kilograms theoretically, 
		the physical design integrated the land and water propellers into one unit so as to minimize the cost. The internal electronics 
		essentially consists of 4 stages: 1.)Transmission/Reception 2.) High frequency amplification 3.) Frequency to analog voltage 
		conversion 4.) Analog to digital conversion and control. Each frequency transmitted is uniquely interpreted upon reception so 
		as to enable the vehicle to execute motion in a different direction. Here, 4 different frequencies are interpreted so as to 
		enable motion in forward, left, right and reverse directions. Further, an onboard circuit to indicate high moisture levels was 
		incorporated.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Molybdenum trioxide nano-particles can be produced by oxidizing molybdenum metal under controlled temperature and pressure. 
		The process of oxidation is itself initiated by heating a thin wire of molybdenum metal by maintaining a high-voltage DC source 
		between the ends of the metal strip. While it is worthwhile noting that the oxidation of the metal can be achieved by using a 
		high voltage AC-signal (Generated using a conventional fly-back transformer), this technique is generally not preferred for the 
		process owing to skin-effect.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		For this purpose, a circuit that converts an AC signal to a desired value of DC must be used. Now, this might be achieved by 
		simply using a rectifier at the optput stage of a voltage up-converter. However, the drawback here is that this design is not 
		flexible enough to tune it to any arbitrary value of DC output voltage.	
	</p>

		As an sophomore, I attended two workshops on Robotics organized by the Robotics and Machine Intelligence group at NIT Trichy. 
		The first workshop focused on building a line-follower robot circuit using an Atmel Atmega8 microcontroller, IR sensors, 
		motor controllers and related components. Towards the end of the first workshop, I realized that programming a microcontroller 
		had its limitations - it simply couldn't process realtime data from the IR sensors as fast as I would have liked it to. 
		Having had a course in digital electronics concurrently, I took up redesigning the circuit with just basic logic blocks.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		I hardcoded the sensor-dependent motor logic in at the output stage of a 1-16 demux (Realized using two 1-8 open-collector demuxes). 
		I used 4 IR sensors - that gave me a unique 4-digit binary number. This binary number was fed as the control input to the demux. 
		Appropriate demux outputs were tied to the source through a resistor. There were essentially 2 signals derived from this - each 
		activates a motor (2 motors were used) when high.
	</p>

		There were IR detectors that fed a base current to transistors that controlled power supply to motors. 
		They were used to stop the line-follower at IR signals. After the third IR signal, the logic was to be inverted - the robot 
		had to follow a white line instead of black. So the IR detectors were interfaced to a digital counter which inverted the 
		inputs when necessary at the input stage itself using an XOR-Gate.

		<b style="font-size:16px;">Attenuating Circuits simulation software (Sept-Oct, 2006)</b>
	</p>

	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The basic functionality of an attenuating circuit is to get a signal of a specific waveform and power level, and output a similar 
		waveform with a relatively lower power. These circuits are necessary at the input stage of any micro-circuit which operate on very 
		low input power - High power levels can fry the internal circuitry.	
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		Any attenuating circuit is generally characterized by Input impedance (Zi), Output impedance (Zo) and Attenuation(α). 
		Given these three parameters, and that input impedance equals the output impedance, it is possible to design a unique 
		L-type equivalent attenuating network for the two effective parameters (Impedance and Attenuation).
	</p>
	
	<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;">
		The software generates circuit diagrams of the L-type network, and equivalent circuitry in symmetric form as T, Pi, 
		Lattice and Bridge type networks. The basic principle that makes this possible is that there is one and only one unique 
		symmetric circuit of the types mentioned before (T, Pi, Lattice and Bridge) for a given L-type network. The length of the 
		impedances as represented in the generated circuit varies logarithmically with the values of the impedances.

		The application was developed using HTML and C++.
