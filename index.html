		</article>
		
		<BR>
		<BR>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			Welcome to my website and thanks for taking the time to visit! (Please note that parts of this website are still evolving and under construction)
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			I'm Shyam Sundar, currently a Software Engineer with the Nanoprobing division of Thermo Fisher Scientific in Richardson, Texas. 
			Here is what I do for a living: Imagine a silicon-based IC chip with billions of transistors. 
			Now, there are some transistors on this chip that are defective. Each transistor is about 1/10000th the diameter of a human hair. 
			How on the earth does one figure out what transistors are defective and why? The first step in solving this problem is to first see 
			those transistors. 
			The second step would be to land nano-sized tungsten probes on the suspected defective transistor pads so that we could measure its electrical 
			characteristics. 
			So what exactly do I do? Well, in short, I design systems and write application software and the vision algorithms to make this possible. 
			In addition, I probably have my fingerprints on every Nanoprober system that goes out of production - partly because I oversee all 
			software aspects of customer systems, and partly because I don't have a habit of wiping the keyboard with rubbing alcohol after I am done &#128522;
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			Prior to this, I was an Electrical Controls and Software Engineer at at Qualitek-VIB, the US division of the VIB Systems Group 
			headquartered in Germany. My work centered on developing, testing and deploying Allen-Bradley PLC code for automating the production of 
			corrugated sheets. Another important aspect of my work was in developing plant process monitoring and reporting software and the 
			languages/tools/libraries I primarily use towards this include ASPX/VB.Net, jQuery, Javascript and Java. 
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			This turns quite a lot of heads - I earned my Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) from the University of London in December 2025.
			The natural question I keep getting asked is - are you leaving Engineering/Science for Law? My answer is that the question is flawed in itself for being loaded. 
			The better question to ask is - "Why Law?". The practical answer is that I first started studying law and successfully sued my old landlord 
			(and collected) after he attempted to unlawfully steal my security deposit, while further admitting that they have no policy of returning security deposits in general. 
			This was followed by a series of personal and professional events related to the legal system. The final trigger was my manager at work who recommended that I pursue a
			law degree after I had helped save his home from an eminent domain possession attempt by the city he lived in via public impact litigation before 
			the County Commissioners Court. I still remember his words - "Shyam, you're an amazing engineer, no doubt. But you'll make a great lawyer."
			I have since been involved as a plaintiff in multiple instances of public impact litigation.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			The philosophical answer to the "Why Law?" question goes down to my curiosity about nature itself. With science and engineering, I try to arrive at
			working solutions to practical issues based on the known rules of physics, which are rather deterministic in nature. Law is quite similar, except that
			we deal with human-made rules, which can be quite abstract in their nature and application. Either way, I see this as a natural extension of the same
			underlying philosophy and an innate desire to understand how things work.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			I graduated with a Masters Degree majoring in Electrical Engineering (Focus: Intelligent Systems) and a minor in Computer Science from Clemson University. 
			My specialization and research interests broadly include Robotics, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, Automation, Control and Electronics. 
			My graduate thesis work was on object recognition and robotic disassembly with Dr. Richard Groff as my advisor. I received my B. Tech Degree in Electronics and Communication 
			Engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NITT), with Dr. S. Raghavan as my advisor and senior project guide.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			If you happen to be a technophile, you'll probably like atleast some of my projects (Some of which have already been posted in this site; 
			continue to watch out for more!). So go ahead and check them out and feel free to mail me if you do have any questions regarding them at 
			a.n.shyamsundar@gmail.com.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			My hobbies include reading (the last few years have been substantially about law, given my pursuit of a law degree), math, circuit design, software programming and 
			break-dancing (You need look no further for a die-hard Michael Jackson fan). 
			And I play chess, badminton, volleyball and occasionally swim.
		</p>
		
		<p style="text-indent: 60px; margin: 20px;"> 
			And, yeah, thanks again for visiting my website and I hope to see you again!
